# Playground
Nothing fancy, just my playground for new libraries, small projects, playing with technologies and code.

### x86 Assembly :
A project for having an experience with x86 assembly of 3 parts 1. LinkedList 2. Heap 3. Stepper Motor controlling we implement them using x86 and irvine32 library for more details: [x86Assembly]( https://github.com/massoudsalem/Playground/tree/master/x86%20Assembly )

### 8Puzzles :

8-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.
The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the bigger 15-puzzle.The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order
by making sliding moves that use the empty space. We implement the game and a small AI algorithm that solve it for more details :

### Digital signal processing :

Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.

### Numerical Methods:

 Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). This is an implementation of them using python. For more details:

 ### Tic Tac Toe:
 Tic Tac Toe, noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. We implement the game and a small AI algorithm that play it for more details :
