# x86 Assembly
This was our Microprocessors course project, In course we have learned basic x86 assembly but we decided to dig deeper and learn irvine32 library and some other out of the course content as a self-study, so we can make things like dynamic allocation to make a good final project of course.

### LinkedList:

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes that together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. We coded heap basic heap functionality `insert`, `delete`, `delete_last`, `insert_after`, `delete_first`, `insert_last`, `insert_first` and `display_list` After implementing Linkedlist we decide to restrict its functionality to stack and queue data structures where LIFO and FIFO methods of data processing are used for more details you can see their codes on :

### Heap :
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

We coded heap basic heap functionality `insert`, `remove` and `top`. In the program main function, we test our heap running an heap-based sorting algorithm called **heapsort** sorting numbers in descending order.

### Stepper Motor controlling :
Control a Stepper Motor with a microcontroller using assembly language.
The motor rotates with a given degree. The motor can operate at two speeds (half speed, and full speed).
Showing its rotating degree in 4 *7-segments* and using a *4x4-keypad* to input the speed and degree of rotation.
