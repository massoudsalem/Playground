# Digital signal processing
Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.

### Technologies used:
- *Python* (modules):
  1. *SciPy*.
  2. *NumPy*.
  3. *Thinkdsp*.
- Anaconda distribution:
  1. *IPython shell*.
  2. *The Jupyter Notebook*.

**Implement ideas :**
1. Basics of signals and systems (draw and create sines, cosines, sawtooth, triangular and square waves. sampling, FFT and DFT).
2. Chromatic scale (basic musical sounds using basic waves like sine).
3. Playing any musical note using letters note and duration for each signals e.g. Happy birthday.
4. Echo and fading using simple shift and scale repeatedly.
5. Mixing sound signals e.g. (bullet shot and it's casting)
6. Convolve music with impact sound.

*Note:*
This methods was implemented under the supervision of my signal and systems professor in collage as an application on signal and systems course.
