# Numerical Methods
 Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics).

*Note:*
This methods was implemented in a numerical methods workshop under the supervision of my mathematics professor in collage _I was assigned to code and explain them to my colleagues._
